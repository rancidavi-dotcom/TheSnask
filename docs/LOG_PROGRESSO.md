# Progress Log — Snask & SnaskStore

This document tracks major project milestones and notes for Snask v0.3.0+.

## Highlights
- SPS project system (manifest + deps + lockfile).
- Import-only native APIs (better boundaries between language core and libraries).
- SNIF format (strict grammar + typed literals + references + safe big integers).
- GUI stack built on GTK3 runtime integration.
